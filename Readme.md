## Assignment 10 - Re-create Etsy Search Page

Utilize the data for whatever search term you use - DATA HERE
Use Bourbon / Neat to help you out (optional, but suggested)
You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.
We haven't covered how to fetch data using JavaScript, so just copy the data and store it in a variable.
Everything should be styled as closely as possible, including the Header/Sidebar/Links/Search
You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages
Also, no need to make any of the form elements work, just style them properly
Lastly, worry about the structure first, the JS second and the fine details of the design last
