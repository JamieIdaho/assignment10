"policy_additional": "*see below for information on iPhone and cell phone cases.\r\n\r\nFor customized vinyl and color selections, if nothing is specified then the default color will be sent and font and text selection will be made at the discretion of Beepart when that applies. \r\n\r\nOur decals all come with easy to understand instructions as well as with a free tester decal.\r\nOur vinyl decals are designed to adhere best to regular latex paints in semi-gloss finish. they will also work with most matte, satin or eggshell finish and will in most circumstances work with gloss finish and even some oil based paints. Our decals will adhere best to smooth surfaces but will work on slightly textured walls. be aware of possible adhesion issues with paint containing teflon or ceramic content.\r\ndue to the wide variety of textures and various wall and painted surfaces, beepart cannot guarantee perfect adhesion to your wall or surface but If you would like to ensure adherence before purchasing just inquire about our test sample pack and we&#39;ll mail one out to you free of charge.\r\nwe advise waiting a minimum of 4 weeks for installation on freshly painted wall surfaces, this gives the paint a chance to completely off-gas.\r\nit is the customer&#39;s responsibility to make sure the wall or surface is suitable for use with our decals (as we cannot inspect each wall surface). \r\nevery beepart decal comes with a free sample/test decal, we advise practicing and testing with this decal before installing your purchased decal.\r\n\r\nOur vinyl decals are rated to last 3-5 years with outdoor use, but when used indoors away from the elements their lifespan is extended significantly.\r\n\r\nOur vinyl decals are designed for a one-time installation and cannot be relocated once they are installed on the surface.\r\nIt is important to make sure you install the decal in the location you want it. We suggest using painter&#39;s tape to place the decal onto the wall location (with the white backing paper un-peeled and intact) and leaving it for a few days to make sure you have it in the best location possible.\r\nWhile our vinyl decals use permanent adhesive, they can be easily removed from most painted surfaces by simply peeling them off. Although it is highly unlikely, beepart cannot be responsible for damage to various wall and other surfaces resulting from removal of the vinyl decals. \r\nif it seems the decal is not easily coming off of the surface, we recommend heating up the vinyl with a hair drier on HOT setting prior to peeling the decal from the surface as this will help loosen the bond of the adhesive.\r\nif you are worried about how our decals will work with your wall or other surface just ask for our free test sample pack and test it on a small part of your surface.\r\n\r\nregarding beepart&#39;s colour selections, please be aware that computer monitors do not give a completely accurate representation of the colour of our vinyl. the descriptive names of the colours are those provided by the manufacturer.\r\nto get a true idea of what our colours look like please contact us for free colour samples and we will mail some out right away.\r\nplease note that colour selection options are subject to change.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that vinyl decals are not toys. All decals should be installed by an adult or with the help of an adult.\r\nDo not allow children to pick at or chew vinyl decals.\r\n\r\nWhen placing decals on car windows please be aware of local laws regarding this, as well be sure that the decal is placed in a location that does not obstruct the driver&#39;s view.\r\n\r\nplease be aware that laptop decals are not laptop &#39;skins&#39; but are computer cut decals.\r\nplease inquire if you are interested in a version of our decals as a &#39;skin&#39;.\r\n\r\n*beepart iPhone and cell phone cases are produced on high quality Case-mate cases.\r\nCase-mate offers a 90-Day Limited Warranty on all products.

"description": "Original and unique! Exquisite art that you can eat off too! \n\nThe quintessential gift for your friends with discriminating taste.\n\nListing is for one 10 inch melamine plate made to order - and made for a good time! Order one, or two, or as many as you like. Also shown here are other designs that can add to a set - listed separately.\n\nPlates feature sweet and original designs sourced from antique and vintage artwork that I enhance, alter, and reproduce. These food safe, dishwasher safe, scratch and fade resistant plates have designs directly related to my “Dictionary Page - Art Prints” at my Etsy shop, FauxKiss, (please visit, http://fauxkiss.etsy.com).\n\nVirtually indestructible, melamine&#39;s sturdy construction is a natural for entertaining at the beach house, cabin, yacht, backyard barbeques, patio place settings or every day use indoors. These plates are superior quality and also make distinctive wall or shelf art!\n\nWhen your plate is created the image actually becomes part of the melamine plate! Not a decal. The end result is a sumptuous plate that is completely safe to eat from and can be used every day, or displayed as a special keepsake. \n\n100% kid friendly and food safe, plates are BPA free, dishwasher safe, and break resistant. Not for microwave or oven.\n\nSHIPPING: Each melamine plate is made to order. Please see my Policies page for important shipping details; http://www.etsy.com/shop/TheMadPlatters/policy \n\nWhite plate view shows the actual plate curves and contours. \n\nSee more plates and platters at http://TheMadPlatters.etsy.com.

"description": "Ive got a lot of vintage prints of Octopus (take a look at my NauticalNell shop for the full range). Octopus reading a book\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nInitial standard shipping on this item is free worldwide\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI offer three styles of prints; \n\n1. ORIGINAL DICTIONARY PRINTS \nThese are printed into genuine antiquarian dictionary pages from the 1830&#39;s. These rare and beautiful pages are of great quality and enhance the artwork fabulously. They have aged over time to a lovely mellow ivory patina and sometimes have occasional irregularities and age marks which adds to their charm. The images are positioned onto the pages so that they can be trimmed to sit perfectly in an 8 x 10inch (20x25.5cm) frame. \n\n2. REPRODUCTION DICTIONARY PRINT POSTERS\nIf you are looking for a slightly larger print, then this is perfect for you. We print an enlarged version of the image onto an A3 page along with an over-print of dictionary page text. The image is centered with a white border ready for framing and looks perfect in a 14x11inch frame\n\n3.  MOUNTED/MATTED ORIGINAL DICTIONARY PRINTS\nYour print will be mounted into an ivory coloured, high quality, precision cut bevelled edge 14x11 inch mount/matt, with a backing board. Safely wrapped in cello, and ready for framing into a standard 14x11 inch frame.\nThis option is available for our Original Dictionary Prints only, and NOT for the 14x11 inch Reproduction Dictionary Print Posters.\nThese prints come with mounts/mats, and do not come framed. \nSee image on this listing for an example.\n\n\n\nSimply select the size that you want when you order. All 8x10 inch prints are on the original dictionary pages. All 14x11 inch prints are printed onto high quality A3 art card and overprinted with dictionary page text.\n\nAll prints are sold unframed and unmounted (with no mats), unless you select to have your print mounted. Your print will not be printed onto the exact page as shown above, but it will be the same style.   We do not offer framed prints.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nShipping\n---------------------------------\nInitial standard shipping worldwide is free. Tracking is not available on this service. For estimated shipping times please click the &#39;Shipping & Policies&#39; tab above. \n\nUS and Canada customers have the option to upgrade shipping to Federal Express International Priority with a 2/3 day service. You can select this option on check out from inside your shopping cart.\n\nA fully tracked courier upgrade is also available for other countries. Check the shipping upgrade option on the right hand side of your shopping cart for details. This is applicable to: UK, Australia, Austria, Belguim, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Spain, Sweden\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nVisit my shops \n---------------------------------\nSee our full range of DottyDictionary prints here:\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/DottyDictionary\n\nFabFunky has my original artwork images on antiquarian dictionary pages.\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/FabFunky\n\nLoopyLolly has lovely art prints that are just a little bit loopy\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/LoopyLolly\n\nNauticalNell will help you bring summer into your home all year round with an enormous selection of coastal home style art prints\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/NauticalNell",

If you can&#39;t &quot;choose&quot; your color it is out of stock, please convo us and we will make it asap!\n\n Octopus mothers are called a &quot;hen.&quot;  They are insanely smart, they can make a home out of almost anything. No mother could give more to their off spring. They fiercely protect their eggs, they tenderly care for their eggs.  She never leaves the eggs to eat.  An octopus is caring, smart, fearless, playful and protective.  All qualities that make us adore our own mom&#39;s.\n\n This purchase is for one planter and air plant. This item is ready to ship. We use what healthy, gorgeous air plants that we have available.\n\nIf you can not order a color, we have run out, please convo us what color you would like.  Allow up to 3 weeks for delivery.\n\nThis little octopus are aprox 2 1/2&quot; tall and 2 1/2&quot; wide at the base.  The octopus are hand thrown in a closed form and then I pebble them with a smooth rock I found from the beach.  They are then bisque fired then glazed, so there will be a natural variation in them.  They come with a cord ready to hang.  The air plants attach with a small wire.  I will send instructions on how to keep your amazing air plant thriving.  The hanging air plants also make wonderfully sea worthy ornaments.\n\nI hand throw a closed form. I carve and add details when it is leather hard and cut it from the base. I paint it with underglaze and then bisque fire it. It is then glazed with a clear glaze and high fired. It is durable and it is food safe. I never have lead in any of my glazes.\n\nCollect a pod of these delightful,dangling sea creatures. We have squid , octopus and jellyfish in many colors to choose from. A great way to start a care free octopus garden with a lot of whimsy.  Makes a great gift as well.  Why send flowers?  When you can send a unique, live plant.\n\n\n Air plants are easy to take care of and they do not need to be planted.  They thrive at the office, at home, in a bright bathroom, even on sheltered porches.   They like bright, filtered light, avoid direct sunlight.  They like good air circulation.  The like humid climates, and should be soaked 2-3 times a week, spray between soakings.  The like the temp to be between 45*-95*.  Use 1/4 strength orchid fertilizer once a month from Mar-October.\n\nStart your octopus garden! \n\nAll designs, descriptions, photos, and creative contents are copyrighted © by  Cindy and James Searles  2014-2015.

"title": "Octopus Art Print, Octopus Illustration, Kraken on a Raging Sea Poster, Wall Art, Beach House Decor, Nautical Man Cave Decor, Gift For Dad",
"description": "Extraordinary octopus art print, also known as a Kraken, attacking a merchant ship, reproduced from an 1802 french illustration. This giant octopus is the stuff that centuries old Norwegian sagas are made of.\n\nI love this print. It is a great conversation piece. &quot;My life is like the ship in that poster&quot; or, &quot;I woke up feeling like the Kraken today&quot;. I feel for the Kraken. It has its tentacles full of what it wanted, but isn&#39;t quite sure how to proceed - or if it really and truly wanted an entire merchant vessel in the first place.\n\nThough I have carefully selected all of my papers to give the best results for the works I offer, I highly recommend the watercolor for this print. It is a 100% cotton rag, heavy weight paper that offers excellent detail and rich color and in addition, lends to the vintage feel of this piece.\n \nIf you would like to see this print in a gallery wrapped canvas print, go here:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/199496489/kraken-canvas-print-wall-hanging-kraken?ref=shop_home_active_1\n\nTo view all of the prints and posters at Adam&#39;s Ale Art Prints, please follow this link: https://www.etsy.com/shop/AdamsAleArtPrints\n\nSPECIAL\nBuy 3 Get 1 Free - Please do not purchase fourth item (or you will be purchasing fourth item). Please let me know in the notes to seller at checkout which print you want for your free fourth.\n\nA POST PURCHASE OFFER\nGo to my Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/adamsaleartprints), like and post a picture of your Adam&#39;s Ale print after you&#39;ve hung it and I will send you a free 8 x 10 of your choice. Message me here to let me know you have posted your print and give me the address to send your print. Don&#39;t forget to let me know which print you want and which paper to \nuse.\n\nMETHOD\nAdam&#39;s Ale art prints are made using a 12 color process fine art printer to insure the most vivid, detailed and long lasting prints. In addition, you can automatically customize your print by choosing from four different paper types during checkout. \n\nPAPER DESCRIPTIONS\nAll papers are heavyweight, acid free museum quality papers.\nMatte: This paper is a smooth, non-glare paper. The finish is soft and well defined.\nWatercolor: This is a textured cotton paper that lends a vintage feel to the prints.\nIf you have anymore questions, please message me.\n\nPRINT LAYOUT\nIf you are ordering prints with wording or captions, the captions for all prints fall within the area measurement of the print(s) that you are purchasing. If you prefer your captions outside of the area so that only the art of the print fills the area (captions will still be there but on the outside of the area) please let me know in the message to seller box at checkout. Thanks!\n\nPRINT BACKGROUNDS\nIf you see prints that you like but aren&#39;t sure the backgrounds will match, message me in your message to seller at checkout that you want all of your backgrounds to match and I will do that. Print set backgrounds match.\n\nPACKAGING AND SHIPPING\nAll prints are sealed in cellophane and mailed in a sturdy cardboard rectangle box that withstands up to 200 pounds of pressure, a sturdy tube, or a cardboard envelope with chipboard reinforcement. Your print will arrive safe or I will replace it.\n\nNEW SIZES AND STRETCHED CANVAS PRINTS\nAdam&#39;s Ale Art Prints now offers print sizes up to 44&quot; wide and canvas prints. Please message if you are interested.\n\nSO YOU DON&#39;T GET DISAPPOINTED\nMats and frames are not included.\n\nSO YOU DON&#39;T WORRY\nAny watermarks shown in listing photos will not be on your print. \n\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you for visiting my shop and taking the time to read all of this info. If you have any questions I didn&#39;t cover, please message my. I reply within 24 hours and more often than not within 3 hours - unless it&#39;s during the sleeping hours.\n\n© AdamsAleArtPrints.
